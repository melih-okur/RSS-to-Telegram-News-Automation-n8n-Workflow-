3.  **Install and run n8n**
    - Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) for installation.
    - Import the `telegram_news_bot.json` file via the **Import Workflow** option in the n8n interface.

4.  **Create a Telegram Bot**
    - Create a new bot on Telegram via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) using the `/newbot` command.
    - Get the token (API) and add it to the n8n credentials section.
    - Add your bot to your channel with "administrator" permissions and approve the required permissions.
    - To find your `Chat ID`:
        - Write any message in the group you created, then use the following URL in your browser:
          
          `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`
          
        - Replace `<TOKEN>` with the token sent by @BotFather.
        - On the page that opens, you will see a JSON output with message details. Find the `chat` object. The `id` value within this object is the `Chat ID` you are looking for.

6.  **Add RSS sources**
    - Enter the RSS URLs into the `RSS 1` and `RSS 2` nodes.
    - [RSS LIST](https://bakinazik.github.io/rss/)
